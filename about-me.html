            </div>
            I am currently working as a law enforcement officer in Singapore. In the past three years, I did criminal investigation and solved a range of violent hurt and financial crimes. I also led a team of first response officers and learnt quite a lot handling time-critical emergencies.
            <br><br>
            On the side, I do full stack web development. I picked up programming and started to build web apps because I wanted to give my ideas real form. I didn't want them to remain in a notebook, delivering no value to the world. In a span of three months, I built a <a href="https://telder.herokuapp.com">machine learning productivity app</a>, a <a href="https://cityfix.herokuapp.com">sandbox incident management app</a>, a <a href="https://standin-app.herokuapp.com">crowdsourcing app for line-sitters<a/>, and a <a href="https://jonathanlimes.github.io/cash-money-game">real-time two-player JavaScript game</a>. I am happy to help people build things for free, just so that I can learn and improve.
            <br><br>
            I often think about how technology can free people to focus on higher-order work, and I am learning how to make that happen. When I'm free I like to read about productivity, cook, biohack, and do olympic weightlifting. Also a closet philosopher.

              If you're interested in technology (or if you're completely different from me), I would love to meet up with you.

              I also do pro bono web development, subject to my work schedule.
